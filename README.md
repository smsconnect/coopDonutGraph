# coopDonutGraph

##Description
An interactive article made for the RIT Media Sciences app. The article features a 'donut graph' (pie graph that is hollow) which shows the different industries in which SMS students get co-ops.

Users can interact with the graph to display the percentage of SMS students that find a co-op in that industry. Interface and interaction animations are built with JavaScript and D3.js (a JavaScript visualization library).

##Article Status
- A version of this interactive article, published on 1/14/16, is live on the RIT Media Sciences app.

##Code Status
1. The code features an outdated back button (weird button at bottom left of screen that pulls down the status bar) that was a work around from the summer/fall of last year.

2. The industries in the article are not what we want. They will need to be changed to match the industryes that the SMS faculty and management decide upon.

3. The data that the graph is constructed from will need to be updated to reflect the industry change as well, and the data should probably be stored in a database.

4. There is an initial description (top of screen) and help section (button in bottom right of screen) that may not be necessary (these are not consistent across the other interactive articles)


###Hayden's Recommendations
- Article needs to provide users with more reasons to look at it and interact with it--linking to other articles in the app based on the selected industry is a good start (currently the article links to the Darwill Co-op story if the user selects the 'Print' industry).
        
    - Possible solution is to provide some background information about the types of jobs that students find in that industry as well as the percentage information and a link to another app article when a user interacts with a section of the graph.
